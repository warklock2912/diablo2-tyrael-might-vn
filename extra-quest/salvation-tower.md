## Story and Plot

As far as we know, humanity was saved by Tyrael's vote in judgment from the High Heavens. Peace has been restored, but the plot of the Buning Hells has not stopped. On the occasion of the Dark Exile, the Three Great Demons Baal, Mephisto and Diablo came to the Sanctuary. However, this scheme was stopped by Tyrael - Archangel of Justice.

The Heroes defeated Mephisto at the Zakarum catacombs, but Diablo had now reached the fortress of Pandemonium to use it as a springboard to attack the High Heavens. However, Diablo did not have time to do that when the group of heroes finally chased him to the place and eventually destroyed him in Buning Hells. The Soul Stone containing Mephisto's soul was also destroyed by the hero at the Forge of Hell to prevent him from returning. As for Baal, after being freed, he went to Mount Arreat, where Inarius placed the World Stone and entrusted it to the Barbarians to guard. Baal's legion attacked Arreat, causing terror throughout the place. Before Baal obtains the World Stone, the group of heroes defeat him. But Baal also seems to have succeeded in soiling the cosmic treasure, and Tyrael has no choice but to destroy the World Stone, causing a terrible tremor throughout the Holy Realm.

At this point it seems that our Diablo2 world has come to an end. But no, these beings from hell are extremely powerful. Although the body is dead and the soul is sealed into the soul stones, they can still be revived through the creation of dark energy around the stone. From there, take over the bodies of those who approach near their detention places to revive them.

Obtained suitable vessel, prepare to resurrect in Salvation. With the secret arts that came from hell, after being revived they took on a new strength, an overflowing vitality, moreover they were gathered together, ready to tear anyone who came to defeat them. In addition, they were able to summon powerfully evolved monster entities to serve as defenders.

The Naphlem team's mission now must find a way to open the entrance to the Salvation and work together to destroy them again. By going back to the places where they were destroyed in order to find the fragments of the stone containing the souls of the three great demons, finally using the Horadric cube of the group of magicians who sealed them to open the entrance Salvation. Inside the map are a series of new Monsters and Bosses that are extremely difficult to play to increase the drama in the maps.
