# Raise Of Uber

## Introduce

Following Chaos Uber (aka Uber Tristram) where the heroes prove that they have conquered and collect valuable rewards are Hellfire Torch and Standard of Heroes. But the war was not over yet, once again the Shadow Summoning ritual was performed by a Sin Sovereign that could be considered the Strongest. He plots to take advantage of Worldstone's power. A stone containing the souls of the almighty Demons that was once used by Lilith (Queen of Succubi) to perform the Dark Summoning ritual in the mortal realm that brought Diablo back to spread Pandemonium throughout Sanctuary.

This time, the defeat of the mighty Demon Uber Baal, Uber Mephisto and Pandemonium Diablo failed to destroy Sanctuary, the rage and desire to destroy Sanctuary were once again fulfilled by Azmodan – Lord of Sin. With all his power, Azmodan revived 3 of the Demons of Heads that had been defeated. Not stopping there, Azmodan also abused the power of the Worldstone to strengthen and transform the Demon to become different from the beginning. Of course, this almighty trio of Demons has become much stronger than the time when the almighty trio failed at Uber Tristram.

The Valrous manuscript lists Azmodan as the best battlefield commander of all demons, having defeated the angels many times in the Eternal Conflict across Pandemonium and the Prime Evils in the demonic civil war. If the Lord of Sin ever assaults our realm, we truly have much to fear. Azmodan, the Lord of Sin was a [Lesser Evil](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Lesser\_Evils) of the [Burning Hells](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Burning\_Hells) and was the last of the [Great Evils](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Great\_Evils) to be trapped in the [Black Soulstone](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Black\_Soulstone).

During the [Great Conflict](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Great\_Conflict), Azmodan successfully defeated his [angelic](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Angel) foes many times on the battlefields of [Pandemonium](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Pandemonium). In one such battle, Azmodan faced the [archangel](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Archangel) [Tyrael](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrael). Tyrael bested him and stood ready to deal the final blow. However, one of Tyrael's [comrades](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Ardleon) called for aid and Tyrael rushed to lend aid. Azmodan thus escaped the angel's wrath.

In another battle against Tyrael (or possibly the same), Azmodan came under direct attack by his angel foes, who were able to use their wings to outmanauver his host and assault him directly. Frustrated by his near defeat, Azmodan began breeding [winged demons](https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic\_Hellflyer) capable of tearing the angels asunder. Once again, only here, the heroes has hope to defeat the trio of Demon, Lord of Sin and save Sanctuary from destruction.

When you collect all 3 main key, you can come back to Pandemonium Fortress and transmute them in the Horadric Cube. This will open the Portal connect to Realm of Sin.
